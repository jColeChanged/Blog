For a long time I wasn't happy with my note taking process, but I've been 
getting better at taking notes. I figured that I would share a 
little about what I've learned about note taking by writing a review of 
two books that recommend cohesive note taking systems. The two books 
I'm reviewing and recommending are The Bullet Journal method 
and How To Take Smarter Notes.

The [The Bullet Journal Method: Track the Past, Order the Present, Design the Future][bullet]
by Ryder Carroll doesn't advertise itself as a book about taking notes. On the surface 
it is a journaling method. In particular it is a journaling method that is optimized for 
speed. Bullet has two meanings: bullet as in, as fast as a bullet and bullet as in, the 
typographical bullet point. So it might seem strange that I would start a post about 
note taking books by talking about journaling.

The reason I think starting with a talk about this book is appropriate is because 
of the way our minds work. What I've observed is that we have two systems in our minds. 
One is adapted for speed. The other is adapted for thinking well. We have to make tradeoffs 
along this time dimension because of limited mental bandwidth. As the name implies, the 
bullet journal is a system that is highly adapted to working quickly. As a result it 
works well as the component of a note taking system that acknowleges our time constraints.

Other note taking strategies acknowledge this too. If you read about note taking systems 
one concept that you are likely to encounter is the 
idea that all things should be written down as notes immediately. People point out that 
notes should be put somewhere and then processed later. The advise that 
there needs to be a fast way to write things down. The mechanism by which many suggest 
doing this is a sort of note inbox.

For me, I've found that the bullet journal method is a good place to put these types of 
quick notes. In particular, I've found it to be more useful than the note inbox abstraction. 
The bullet journal acts as a kind of structured log that we can process later, which is the 
critical thing, but it is also more powerful and general than the inboxing abstraction.

To dig a bit deeper into what I mean by that: the inboxing abstraction treats itself like 
a queue. Put things into it and later remove things from it as appropriate. The Bullet 
Journal method initially works in the same way. Things are put into the log. However, that 
log is part of a task scheduling framework. Tasks can be pushed to a future log, they 
can be scheduled to a particular month, and there is a built in mechanism for ensuring that 
the log gets processed.

In the inbox abstraction people expect you to process the queue implicitly. In the bullet 
journal method each day starts with the process of moving notes from the daily log to the 
next daily log. That steps is a natural point for the queue to be processed and priotized.
It is also a natural time for other journal entries which are concerned with tracking the 
year, month, and week to be updated as appropriate based on the contents of the daily log.
The inbox abstraction is treating your notes as things to be processed and forgotten. The 
bullet method is treating your daily logs as a kind of structured log that gets processed 
once it has reached a certain size.

Not a lot of people talk about the bullet journal using this sort of language. 
People who post their journals publicly are spending a lot of time on form rather than function, 
which is fine from an athestic point of view, but rather against the spirit which motivates 
the use of a bullet journal methodology. In practice, the Bullet Journal isn't so great for 
art. It is great for controlling attention and keeping track of things when there is little 
time available to do so. So most public discussion of the bullet journal doesn't tend to meditate 
on this aspect and a lot of people confuse using the bullet journal method with drawing pretty 
pictures.

Basically what I'm trying to get at is that if you're using the bullet journaling methodology, 
you shouldn't adopt an inbox methodology, but if you are using the inbox technique it is 
probably worthwhile to upgrade your inbox by transitioning to a bullet journal. If you don't 
take any notes at all though, this is a place to start. Critically, don't be confused by why 
you are using the system. People will draw pretty pictures and because they are pretty that is 
what you will see from people using the Bullet Journal, but that isn't the point of the Bullet 
Journal.

You have to be real time before you can handle being non-real time. So I covered the speed aspect 
of note taking first. Now I'm going to move on to getting more and more value from your notes over
time.

[How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers](smarter) is a book by Sönke Ahrens. It is the best book I've encountered on the subject of note taking. Sönke is one of the authors who realizes that our mediums are part of the thinking process, though like many, he limits this idea that our environments are thinking environments to just the idea that our writing is our thinking environment.

This is a common error: mediums have natural incentives and incentives control behavior. So mediums end up influence what is produced within them. They aren't neutral. Since in practice writing has better incentives for thinking, it is the natural medium for good thinking. People recognize this and end up thinking that writing is thinking. In reality, all our interactions with the environment are a part of thinking, writing just tends to be better thinking and other mediums tend to corrupt it.

What the book is really about though isn't so much note taking in general as it is a specific note taking strategy. To oversimplify for the sake of communicating the main idea, there was a person who was not formally educated who innovated in the methodology that he used to take notes. This innovation led to his notes becoming such a powerful tool that he leveraged them to produce upwards of fifty books. So great was the enhancement to his productivity that it stood out notably and became an object of study based on the merit of its enhancement.

The actual note taking methodology itself can be described very simply as two big ideas.

The first idea is that instead of taking notes for the purposes of remembering facts, notes are taken in paragraph form. In effect they are taken as if they are already being written for publication, complete with bibliographic citation for tracking down the sources that the writing leverages. This is the first idea and it would obviously produce improvements in productivity since the step of transforming thinking into words to share is done at the stage at which the information is acquired rather than later when there would be a search cost for taking the same action. 

The second idea is to produce notes as a graph. To link one note to the next. By walking the graph produced by the links a person walks over entire articles, pages, and books that have already been written and are nearly ready for publication. Notes become the tool of writing a first draft, since writing a first draft becomes copying in your writing from your notes.

Although simple to explain to someone who is already familiar with both the web and writing the combination of mediums has surprising power and is worth reading the book to understand more fully. Especially since there are many other valuable insights about note taking in the book.

The thing is, the act of writing these larger paragraphs represents real cognitive investment. You're basically using your note taking process to 
do what people often think of as homework - writing essays or truly ambitious work - writing a book. Or more to the point - you're thinking. 
In practice that means that this method of taking 
notes requires time. It doesn't fit well into our real time working environments. It is a system that works very well as a processing step which goes 
after the initial inboxing work. It is a system for developing thoughts. It is basically solving the problem of thinking about the notes we take and 
then getting value from those notes in the future.
