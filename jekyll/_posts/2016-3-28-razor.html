<!-- I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord. He is the Son of God and ruler over all. /-->
<!-- If any glory comes from this, let it go to him. /-->
<p>
	I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord and that He is the Son of God and ruler over all. I've come to realize that my beliefs aren't just justified rationally, but that certain appeals that once seemed very suggestive of my own irrationality are at their heart fallicious. As a consequence of this I am not writing an apology, but rather I'm trying to cast down a false teaching which blinds people to the truth: both truth in Jesus Christ and also scientific truth. I'm going to be going over what Occam's Razor is, why I find it to be theoretically flawed, why I believe it to have been practically useful, and some predictions as to what is likey to happen in the future given that my suppositions are true. 
</p>

<p>
	Wikipedia, in the year 2016, had it written that:

	<blockquote>
		Occam's razor […] is a problem-solving principle attributed to William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347), who was an English Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher and theologian. The principle can be interpreted as stating <i>Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.</i>
	</blockquote>

	Then they go on to define it in much more detail, because it turns out that this pithy saying doesn't do justice to the principle; its too easy to misunderstand, because of the equivocal language.
</p>


<p>
	I think it is very fair to say that language is a tricky thing. In the book of Genisis there is the tale of human language being multipled in number. In Greek philosophy Socartese makes a fool of people in part by teasing out inconsitency in the definitions of virtues. In the face of all this I find myself quite skeptical of the modern claim that brevity is king in writing, because it seems to me that more important than brevity is understanding. Ludwig Wittgenstein, more brief than most, found this out. He thought himself to have solved philosophy with a book that was extremely terse. His next major philosophical treaty was on language; apparently people didn't understand him. So I'm not hoping to be terse here and may even repeat myself in different ways in the hope of getting across the fundamental ideas without distortion. If I repeat things twice, but the two passages do not harmonize together, it is not because my writing is broken. The understanding that is correct is the one which harmonized the two of them. I say this because I believe that what I'm sharing is worth knowing so that you will bear with me in a bit of reptition. I also say it because I want to get across how very right it is to ask questions of me. Not only would someone who didn't understand me not be an idiot if they did not understand me, but also I would not be an idiot for having failed to achieve their understanding.

<p>
	I believe some things things that many agree with and others disagree with. Some people have falsely claimed that the beliefs I hold are incoherent, but I disagree. I also think that some of the tools they use to make me seem incoherent are cutting apart proper thinking moreso then they are damaging my own inclusive claims. I don't say this to mean that they damage me at all, but rather themselves in all pursuits in which they cut themselves, both spiritual and physical. So I want to share what I've noticed about Occam's Razor from the perspective of a programmer.

<p>
	It's important to not confuse what is meant by basic. So here are some more quotes to help disambugiate that concept.
</p>

<p>
	Wikipedia states the following three things about the principle:

	<blockquote>
		Occam's razor is not an embargo against the positing of any kind of entity, or a recommendation of the simplest theory come what may.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure (or syntax), while its ontology (or semantics) becomes simpler, or vice versa.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.
	</blockquote>

</p>

<p>
	Now consider this second more complicated search function:

	<pre id="secondSearch"></pre>
</p>

<p>
	And this even more complicated search function:
	
	<pre id="thirdSearch"></pre>
</p>

<p>
	Fundamentally each of these programs, if all we were able to see was the suppositions entered and the output with no other information, would be equivalent in terms of output. However, each one was built out of more complicated pieces. Each of these programs had potential usefulness to the addition of complexity. However, it is also the case that there an infinite number of programs that could produce the same output. This truth refutes the use of Occam's Razor as a tool for rejecting inclusive explanations, because there are of necessity an infinite number of other ways that could have produced the same observations, and though there is only one simplest explanation, there are many more which are inclusive of the simplest explanation.
</p>

<p>
    Now I'm going to go over why it is practically useful. I see two large reasons:

    <ol>
    	<li>
    		Consider a space of infinite programs. If there is a program in that infinite space that works at some things, it is better to make small changes to it rather than huge overhauls. Or to put this a different way, it is better to do a directed search rather than an undirected search. This still leaves the problem of local optima to deal with, but explains the practical benefit of Occam's Razor. This understanding forces Occam's Razor to fail as a heuristic, since it inevitably doesn't solve the problem of local optima.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		Occam's Razor is a simplification tool. It suggests taking equations like "3 * 4 (bear-symbol-not-used) + a + b" and reducing them to "12 + a + b".
    	</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
	I like the way I like the way Ludwig Wittgenstein put it. 
	<blockquote>
		If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam's Razor.
	</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    And:

    <blockquote>
    	Occam's Razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule nor one justified by its practical success. It simply says that unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing. Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent; signs which serve no purpose are logically meaningless.
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    So since God says he is findable and gives instructions on how to to find him, it follows that the fact that people have found him when following these things demands that his inclusion is not rejected. Especially since knowing that "12 + a + b" doesn't tell us the why beind "12 + a + b".
