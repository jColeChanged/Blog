title: Learning to Program

I've watched several people who are learning to program try to solve programming problems and one of the things I've noticed is that it is the basics, not the complicated things, which really seem to trip people up. This can continue even after a person has taken classes which claims to teach how to program. Someone can be taught about a for loop, understand what a for loop is, and yet somehow putting the for loop into practice can seem mystifying.

My observation matches with what I've read about programming education and interviews. Professors have found that they can predict whether someone will pass a programming course just on the basis of whether a person has a mental model of how to program, even if that mental model is wrong, so long as the mental model is reasonable and consistent. Interviewers have found that they can predict how well someone will do on harder interview problems by seeing if they can solve extremely trivial problems.

I think what is happening here is that a working mental model of program execution is a bit like gaining an understanding of phonemes when learning to read. Critical. Foundational. It is the small kernel upon which the larger things are built.

There is something to being able to solve the smallest of problems that is necessary to doing well in a more general way. This makes a lot of sense if you think about it, since one way to think about a large computer program is just as the composition of many much smaller computer programs.

In my eyes, building this mental model is an exercise in monotony, but it isn't hard. It just requires active learning focused on building up the foundational understanding. The basic idea is to type a lot of simple code, predict the results in your head, and then see the results in actuality. If you have fun doing it, you'll probably do it for longer, explore more, and end up getting a better understanding. A good book for this is one of the ones by Zed Shaw which follows the naming template of [Learn X the Hard Way](https://shop.learncodethehardway.org/). Do the exercise. Go through the monotony of typing things out. Books written for more expert people tend to skip over the major pain point.

If you don't want to buy a book, another way to go about developing this skill is to find some code you are interested in, read through code and execute it in your head. With a pen and paper in hand or using some sort of writing app, execute the code in your head and write down what you think happens. Keep track of the values in each variable as you go from line to line. Then run the program with a debugger active or tons of print or logging lines added and compare your understanding of what should happen with what actually happened. The point here is to make the computer tell you about how the program executes, since you are still working on your own mental model of program execution. Whenever there is divergence between what happened and what you thought would happen, ask why, and search for the answer.

If you do this several times for a small program that you wrote, but can't explain confidently, you can expect your grasp of that program to change. You'll eventually be able to run through what the code is doing quickly. Doing the exercise will start to feel boring, because you already know what will happen. No lines will be a mystery. That is what it feels like when you are gaining the critical mental model.
