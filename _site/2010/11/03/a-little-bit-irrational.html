  <h1 class="title">A Little Bit Irrational</h1>
	<p>My uncle Tim asked me to run a card game at the local bowling alley. People bought into the game for one dollar and all of their money was then put into a pot that goes to the winner of the game. If nobody won the pot would carry over to the next week. The carry over would continue until someone did manage to win. Winning was a little harder. In order to win you had to draw a specially marked card from a deck of five-hundred cards.</p>

<p>When I did the math, I realized that getting into the card game didn&#8217;t make much sense. When I broke things down I found that there was roughly a 1% chance of winning the game. You can use that information to calculate the average amount which will be won.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Average Win = Chance To Win * Pot Size</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, knowing how much you were expected to win isn&#8217;t very useful unless you factor in how much you had to pay to have a chance at winning the money. If we put all this together we find that our expected return on each game is our chance to win multiplied by the pot size minus the amount we payed to get into the game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Average Return = Win Chance * Pot - Buy In</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what happens when we plug in our 1% chance to win, our $1 oppurunity cost, and graph the result?</p>

<p><img alt='Average Returns' src='/img/a-little-bit-irrational/average-return.png' /></p>

<p>Basically, unless the pot has more then a hundred dollars in it, you are going in expecting to lose money. So since there is no guarantee that you will stay in every week, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to get into the game, unless you are doing it for the social experience.</p>
