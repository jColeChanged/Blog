            <h4>Philosophy</h4>
            <p>
                This site was originally a personal blog and a way to share a little 
                about myself with people who were interested. Most of the content I 
                wrote was about things that I was learning or doing, but I'm not 
                particularly enthused to share my personal details on the internet and 
                producing content mostly focused around things which I'm only just 
                starting to know leads to content which isn't worth reading relative 
                to the wonderful works available elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                So after a lingering existence in which not much content was produced 
                I switched to a different approach. I tried to use my blogging as a 
                tool for reducing how often I had to repeat myself and as a way to 
                teach about concepts and techniques that I considered valuable. I 
                was much happier with what I produced with this approach to content 
                production.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still this approach had problems. A lot of the concepts and ideas I 
                most wanted to write about and share never ended up getting posted 
                since producing them was hard and I rarely got the work to a point 
                where I felt satisfied sharing it. A big part of this was that I have 
                other things that war for my attention. I write stories online, I 
                compete in the top 1% in video games, and I'm employed as a software / 
                machine learning engineer at a FANG.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, to avoid getting caught in the mire I've been stuck in, this is not 
                a blog. At the risk of sounding melodramatic this is a place where I'm 
                trying to grow and evolve written thought for the purpose of helping 
                myself and others understand the world better and operate within it more 
                effectively. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be places where things are not polished. There will be corners 
                that are cut. There will be dead ends and things which are ugly. The plumbing 
                may make itself known to you. This is an open ended attempt at creation and 
                exploration. It is not a finished work.
            </p>
