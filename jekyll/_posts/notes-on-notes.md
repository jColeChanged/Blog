I've been iterating on my note taking process for years now and I've arrived at 
something which I'm not as ashamed of as the notes I accreted in my youth. I 
figured that I would share a little about what I've learned about note taking 
by way of a review of two books that have strongly influenced my note taking 
process.

The first strongly influential book is The Bullet Journal Method by Ryder Carroll. 
At a high level the basic idea is to have different types of journal pages which are 
each optimized for specific purposes. For the default page types in particular, the 
ones that most commonly used, the journal process is highly optimized for speed.

Bullet has two meanings in this case. Bullet as in, as fast as a bullet, but also bullet 
as in bullet points not paragraphs. That second point is all the more true, because the 
typographical elements of the bullet journal are mostly variants on the a bullet point. 
Tasks start with a bullet and when they are finished they are either crossed out or become 
an arrow which indicates they've been carried forward in time. There are several bullet 
point variants. Some for events which contain a set of of other events. Some for specific 
events. Each of them is a tiny deviation from a basic bullet point and it is clear in using 
and understanding the typographic choices made that their design was optimized for speed.

I want to call attention to one aspect of the bullet journal methodology which I consider 
it's greatest strength and advantage. Tasks go into a bullet journal and when they aren't 
finished within the bounds of a day there is a notation to indicate that they are being 
moved forward to future days.

The bullet journal methodology is a great place to store tasks. The default page types are 
concerned with the future in general, the year as a whole, a particular month, a particular week, 
and a particular day. The process recognizes itself as a task scheduling system. That translation 
step I mentioned has dedicted time during which tasks added to other time period spreads can be 
brough into the context of today where they can be given their due focus.








I encountered the Bullet Journal when I was iterating on my note taking system. I've long 
kept notebooks, but I noticed that my note taking system wasn't producing value for me when 
I looked back on it and I understood this to be an error in the way I was approaching things. 
I adopted the bullet journal system to help add structure to my notes and I found it to be 
beneficial. I took notes more consistently and got much more value out of my notes.

The Bullet Journal method is different from other journal methodologies in that it isn't 
suggesting that people write full journal entries. It is recommending that people write out 
things quickly. Even the typographical elements of the journal have been optimized to allow 
for the speedy writing of the journal.

If you look at people who are doing bullet journaling publicly, it won't be obvious that this 
is the true advantage of the bullet journal. People who post their journals publicly are 
spending a lot of time on form rather than function, which is fine from an athestic point of 
view, but rather against the spirit which motivates the use of a bullet journal methodology.





and for the journal pages which we interact with 
most regularly to be optimized so as to minimize the amount of time that it takes to 
create them. This design choice for interacting with notes extends into the indexing 
methodology as well, which is also designed to minimize the amount of time that is 
spent in indexing.


However, although the book improved my note taking structure, I still had one of the same problems I had before I adopted the note taking methodology. My notes didn't tend to be of lasting value. I tried experimenting with different indexing strategies in order to continue getting value from my notes by using the idea of named notebooks, but in practice my notes didn't tend to build on each other. The one exception to this was that my daily spreads built on each other quite naturally. So time carried forward like I would hope, but conceptual linking didn't tend to do so.

The bullet journal is designed with a paper notebook in mind. It is optimized for that use case from the perspective of minimizing the amount of time that is spent taking notes. The value of notes is recognized, but the degree of time spent on taking notes is minimized. Notes are seen as a necessary thing for keeping track of state, but real work is seen as something which exists outside the context of the note taking environment.

I've come to realize that the good ideas in the Bullet Journal methodology correspond with the idea of an Inbox in other productivity and note taking systems. The Bullet Journal is secretly an inbox mechanism. It is also about writing things into an inbox in a very clever way. It also fulfills that purpose much better than the traditional conception of an inbox, because unlike the traditional inbox task queue it recognizes deferred actions. A traditional inbox mechanism has a queue that needs to be processed, but it can be long and have tasks which of necessity need to come much later. The bullet journal methodology has dedicated pages for tasks in the future. It also has a recommended interaction paradigm which moves tasks to relevant contexts as it becomes appropriate to do so.

So if you're using the bullet journaling methodology, you shouldn't adopt an inbox methodology, but if you are using the inbox technique it is probably worthwhile to upgrade your inbox by transitioning to a bullet journal. If you don't take any notes at all though, this is a place to start. There are other books that go into how to take notes well in order to solve the notes remaining valuable over time issue. Although this doesn't solve that problem, it does solve sub-problem in note taking which those books will suggest: the initial capture of ideas.

## How To Take Smarter Notes

How To Take Smarter Notes: 10 Principles to Revolutionize Your Note-Taking and Writing is a book by Sönke Ahrens. It is the best book I've encountered on the subject of note taking. Sönke is one of the authors who realizes that our mediums are part of the thinking process, though like many, he limits this idea that our environments are thinking environments to just the idea that our writing is our thinking environment.

This is a common error: mediums have natural incentives and incentives control behavior. So mediums end up influence what is produced within them. They aren't neutral. Since in practice writing has better incentives for thinking, it is the natural medium for good thinking. People recognize this and end up thinking that writing is thinking. In reality, all our interactions with the environment are a part of thinking, writing just tends to be better thinking and other mediums tend to sabotage good thinking.

I feel that Sönke doesn't mistake writing for the only vehicle of thinking as strongly as others authors do, since unlike many who make this mistake he is on the cusp of realizing this error. He encourages a graph-structure for note taking. This implicitly crosses the medium divide between writing and the web. 

What the book is really about though isn't so much note taking in general as it is a specific note taking strategy. To oversimplify for the sake of communicating the main idea, there was a person who was not formally educated who innovated in the methodology that he used to take notes. This innovation led to his notes becoming such a powerful tool that he leveraged them to produce upwards of fifty books. So great was the enhancement to his productivity that it stood out notably and became an object of study based on the merit of its enhancement.

The actual note taking methodology itself can be described very simply as two big ideas.

The first idea is that instead of taking notes for the purposes of remembering facts, notes are taken in paragraph form. In effect they are taken as if they are already being written for publication, complete with bibliographic citation for tracking down the sources that the writing leverages. This is the first idea and it would obviously produce improvements in productivity since the step of transforming thinking into words to share is done at the stage at which the information is acquired rather than later when there would be a search cost for taking the same action. 

The second idea is to produce notes as a graph. To link one note to the next. By walking the graph produced by the links a person walks over entire articles, pages, and books that have already been written and are nearly ready for publication. Notes become the tool of writing a first draft, since writing a first draft becomes copying in your writing from your notes.

Although simple to explain to someone who is already familiar with both the web and writing the combination of mediums has surprising power and is worth reading the book to understand more fully. Especially since there are many other valuable insights about note taking in the book.
