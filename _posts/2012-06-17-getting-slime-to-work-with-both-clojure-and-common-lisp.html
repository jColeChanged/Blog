title: Getting Slime to Work With Both Clojure and Common Lisp
published: true
---
<p>Though I don&rsquo;t have any large projects in Common Lisp I&rsquo;ve been reading an <a href="http://norvig.com/paip.html">book on AI</a> which is filled with programs written in the language. Having had the pleasure of using slime and swank when programming in Clojure, I knew that I wanted to use them again when working through the code in the book. As soon as I tried to do so I realized that I had a problem on my hands.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the slime used by Clojure and the slime used by Common Lisp aren&rsquo;t exactly the same. The Clojure slime crashes when trying to connect to a swank server for common lisp and vice versa. Luckily I ended up finding <a href="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/notes/emacs-setup/">Arnab Deka&rsquo;s site</a>. Arnab encountered the same problem as me and had already solved the issue.</p>

<p>So the only problem I had was that clisp was that my clisp wasn&rsquo;t in <code>usr/local/bin/clisp</code> like it was in the github link he posted. I had installed my clisp with <code>sudo apt-get install clisp</code> and it hadn&rsquo;t put it there. I found out where it had been put by running <code>find | grep bin/clisp</code> from the <code>/</code> directory. It ended up being in <code>usr/bin/clisp</code>. Once I had changed the bit of lisp code he supplied to reflect this <code>M-x common-lisp-slime</code> started working like it was supposed too.</p>
