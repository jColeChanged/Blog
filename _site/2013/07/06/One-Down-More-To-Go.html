<p><a href='http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm'>MIT OpenCourseWare</a> has the best Computer Science courses I&#8217;ve taken thus far. I love them, but its taken me a long while to work through them. I&#8217;m busy with other things, from programming project to playing video games. I don&#8217;t always put in the time for study that I would like to.</p>

<p>However, my slow progress has not been no progress. I&#8217;ve learned a lot. I&#8217;ve learned how necessary it is to break problems into smaller problems and then to peice them back together. I&#8217;ve learned how to use stastical packages like <a href='http://www.scipy.org/PyLab'>pylab</a> to make charts. I&#8217;ve learned methods of machine learning like clustering which turn out to be far simpler then I would have imagined. There has been a ton of growth.</p>

<p>I know I&#8217;m not done yet. I still have plenty more to learn. I&#8217;m just thankful that I am learning. Today I finished all of one of the <a href='http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/'>MIT courses that I took</a>. Now I&#8217;m moving on to the next MIT course. One step at a time, I&#8217;m going to learn all that I want to learn so that I can be the programmer and statistician that I desire to be.</p>
