	I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord. He is the Son of God and ruler over all. If any glory comes from this, let it go to him. In this blog post I'm going to be going over why Occam's Razor is theoretically flawed when rejecting explanations, why it remains practically useful, and how its application as a search heuritistic in a quest for truth is likely to lead to local optima in our understanding of how things work.
</p>


<p>
	In the story about the tower of Babel, God cursed the world with many languages. In practice, this means most times I say these things, people don't understand me. So lets start off by defining Occam's Razor to try and avoid misunderstandings.

	Wikipedia, in the year 2016, had it written that:

	<blockquote>
		Occam's razor […] is a problem-solving principle attributed to William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347), who was an English Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher and theologian. The principle can be interpreted as stating <i>Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.</i>
	</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile Rationalwiki, also in 2016, put it this way:

	<blockquote>
		Occam's razor is a scientific/philosophical principle which states that one should never make more assumptions than the minimum necessary to explain something; or, if you don't have explicit evidence to believe that something is true, then you should not. The "razor" is used to "shave off" the unnecessary bits of a solution.
	</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
	It's important to not confuse what is meant by basic. So here are some more quotes to help disambugiate that concept.
</p>

<p>
	Wikipedia states the following three things about the principle:

	<blockquote>
		Occam's razor is not an embargo against the positing of any kind of entity, or a recommendation of the simplest theory come what may.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure (or syntax), while its ontology (or semantics) becomes simpler, or vice versa.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.
	</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
	Rationalwiki puts some of these ideas in these ways:

	<blockquote>
		Often people use "term" as a synonym for "word" and imagine that the theory which can be described in the simplest way is selected by Occam's razor. This is not the case; one must carefully (and honestly) separate all assumptions being made.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		You cannot explain anything by simply replacing an unknown with an unknown which has a different name. If the hypothesis offers no clue how the result is reached, it is not simple, it is useless.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		Woo-meisters and creationists sometimes use Occam's razor incorrectly as a handwave to avoid facing the fact that the point they are arguing requires a completely unknown mechanism. [...] It's also quite easy for skeptics to fall for this one, citing Occam's razor as evidence itself, rather than finding evidence to refute a concept.
	</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
   Now with the definitons out of the way, I'm going to refute the theoretical validity of Occam's Razor when it is used to reject inclusive definitions. Consider the following three search programs:
</p>

<p>
	<pre id="firstSearch"></pre>
</p>

<p>
	Now consider this second more complicated search function:

	<pre id="secondSearch"></pre>
</p>

<p>
	And this even more complicated search function:
	
	<pre id="thirdSearch"></pre>
</p>

<p>
	Fundamentally each of these programs, if all we were able to see was the suppositions entered and the output with no other information, would be equivalent in terms of output. However, each one was built out of more complicated pieces. Each of these programs had potential usefulness to the addition of complexity. However, it is also the case that there an infinite number of programs that could produce the same output. This truth refutes the use of Occam's Razor as a tool for rejecting inclusive explanations, because there are of necessity an infinite number of other ways that could have produced the same observations, and though there is only one simplest explanation, there are many more which are inclusive of the simplest explanation.
</p>

<p>
    Now I'm going to go over why it is practically useful. I see two large reasons:

    <ol>
    	<li>
    		Consider a space of infinite programs. If there is a program in that infinite space that works at some things, it is better to make small changes to it rather than huge overhauls. Or to put this a different way, it is better to do a directed search rather than an undirected search. This still leaves the problem of local optima to deal with, but explains the practical benefit of Occam's Razor. This understanding forces Occam's Razor to fail as a heuristic, since it inevitably doesn't solve the problem of local optima.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		Occam's Razor is a simplification tool. It suggests taking equations like "3 * 4 (bear-symbol-not-used) + a + b" and reducing them to "12 + a + b".
    	</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
	I like the way I like the way Ludwig Wittgenstein put it. 
	<blockquote>
		If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam's Razor.
	</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    And:

    <blockquote>
    	Occam's Razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule nor one justified by its practical success. It simply says that unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing. Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent; signs which serve no purpose are logically meaningless.
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    So since God says he is findable and gives instructions on how to to find him, it follows that the fact that people have found him when following these things demands that his inclusion is not rejected. Especially since knowing that "12 + a + b" doesn't tell us the why beind "12 + a + b".
