I'm trying to become better at statistics. So naturally, learning to chart things programatically was appealing to me. So when I was working through the MIT Single Variable Calculus course I made a point of drawing out prototype charts that I would later try to reproduce in code. With my Calculus course out of the way I can now reveal the results of that charting practice.
