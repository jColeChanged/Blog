<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">I recently started reading Edward Tufte&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.&rdquo; In it Tufte spends some time going over the history of the field. He notes that many charts require both artistic and statistical ability which are rarely found together. So a lot of the charts that could have been made in ancient times have only been created in the last few hundred years as these skills became more commonplace. My reaction to this was to wonder what would happen when those two abilities would collide with a third, the ability to program. I didn&rsquo;t have to wait long for an answer.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;</span><br /><a href="http://chess.com/"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">Chess.com</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">, a site which does about what you would expect, is already giving a a glimpse of the sorts of things you see when these varied talents work beside each other. Most chess sites have users select the games they will play by searching through a list of all games. The list is usually a table which lets you sort by the attributes that you're interested in.</span></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium; text-align: left; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;</span><br /><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yOK8dZ4pyci7m_yhx08iTg2nFQGpNmqeb2jDMNJZZamWl1Ia5GyURhyB8cuL6P--wltsL7p0eAXwutSoM_68G_U_OJ3WAE5vvE3sps9ztm4W64o_4liH9e5INS8g3q4e" height="258px;" alt="Picture of an interactive table view of available chess games" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="374px;" /><p /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">This site takes a slightly novel approach. In addition to a table they also offer a graph through which you can select your opponent. The x-axis of the graph is the length of the game. The y-axis of the graph is the rating at which the game will be played. Unlike the tabular format you don&rsquo;t need to sort based on the attribute you're interested in, since everything is already sorted. Unrated games are distinguished by a white circle.</span></div>

<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium; text-align: left; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">What strikes me about this convergence is that it has produced something that is highly intuitive and very easy to use. Tufte has emphasized that some of the better graphic styles are better because they can be understood intuitively. Meanwhile, many web designers have argued that a good design doesn&rsquo;t make its users think. This graphic accomplishes the latter by being the former. In a nutshell, it shows that when these three talents converge you get not only a good graphic, but a good web design too.</span></div>
