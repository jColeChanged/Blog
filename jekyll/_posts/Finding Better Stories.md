#Machine Learning: Finding Better Stories#

Fanfiction.net is a site which collects stories written by tons of different authors. Not all of these stories are good and they have over 600,000 stories hosted on the site. However, some of them are good. Very good. There are several published authors who are writing there in their spare time.

After more then a few weeks of using reviews and sifting through bad writing manually, I realized that I knew how to program. Moreover, I realized that I had an interest in solving problems just like the one I have.

So I scraped fanfiction.net to get a dataset of all of its stories and the connections between them. People have done this before. They made search engines. That wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking to build a recommendation engine.

You can get a copy of the dataset from my github.
