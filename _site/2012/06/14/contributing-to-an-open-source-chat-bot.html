            I'm a programmer, an aspiring statistican, and a Christian. I'm also into competitive gaming, especially League of Legends. My writing here tends to focus on things I'm learning about through self-study. If that interests you, enjoy!

  <h1><a href="/2012/06/14/contributing-to-an-open-source-chat-bot.html">Contributing to an Open Source Chat Bot</a></h1>
  <h2 class="muted date"><small>14 Jun 2012</small></h2>
	<p>My first ever contribution to an open source project that wasn&rsquo;t my own was a <a href="https://github.com/jColeChanged/sexpbot">plugin</a> for an IRC chat bot in #clojure on freenode. The plugin was called findfn, because that is what it did. When someone types something in IRC along the lines of <code>findfn 2 2 4</code> it would return a list of all the functions which would return <code>4</code> after being passed <code>2</code> twice. In that example it would probably return the operators for both addition and multiplication. Other times it might return first, last, map, or any number of other functions.</p>

<p>To do this the plugin took a brute force approach. There weren&rsquo;t any clever means of figuring out what would return what, though it would be probably be possible to do that given functions with the the right metadata. Instead it went through all the functions in the the core namespaces and tested each of them to see if applying all but the last argument would return a result which matched the last argument.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long after that I submitted the plugin that I saw it being rolled out in #clojure. Then only a little while after that I saw the plugin being merged into the core of the bot. For a first time contribution to open source I was pretty happy with the result. People actually found something I had helped to build to be useful.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really glad that I had the chance to give back to the IRC community in #clojure. For those of you who program in Clojure, but haven&rsquo;t been there, you&rsquo;re really mssing out. It is home to some of the nicest and most helpful people I&rsquo;ve met online. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that I ended up having more questions answered in the IRC chat and through searching its logs then I did on <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>.</p>

<p>At the very least I know that I would never have submitted the plugin if it weren&rsquo;t for some of the people in the channel. Especially one of the regulars, amalloy. He helped me root out a bug in the initial impementation of the function and also guided me thruogh submitting the plugin to the open source project.</p>
