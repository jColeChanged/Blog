  <h1 class="title">Probability Confuses</h1>
	<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">Most of the people who read this blog have already discovered that I'm interested in both probability and statistics. What they might not guess is that this passion of mine leads to conflict with my family. Not serious conflict. I'm not talking about anger, raised voices, and strained relationships. I'm talking about the sort of conflicts which always seem to be sprouting up when probability is under discussion.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">Probability theory rose out of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/pascal.pdf" style="margin-top: 0px;">letters between Balise Pascal and Pierre Fermat</a>. Each of these letters was exceedingly polite. So much so that a modern reader might think the polite wordings were some sort of joke. So it is ironic that these&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pRM4v0O29o#t=5m00s">letters which changed the way people see the world</a>&nbsp;had a disagreement near their core.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">Pascal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat">Fermat</a>&nbsp;were trying to figure out the correct way to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_points" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">divide the pot of an unfinished game</a>, but they did not agree about how to do it. Even from the start probability problems were showing themselves to be confusing to the brightest. Hundreds of years later probability still confuses us.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">In 1975&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant" style="margin-top: 0px;">Marilyn vos Savant</a>, who was in the record books for having the worlds highest IQ, published what it is now known as the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Monty Hall problem</a>:</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify; margin: 0px;">Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">Savant claimed that the best thing to do in this sutation would be to switch doors. She correctly reasoned that by switching doors you would give youreself a&nbsp;<span class="mathInline" style="margin-top: 0px;"><span class="MathJax" style="display: inline; font-family: serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; font-size: 18px; text-indent: 0px; text-align: left; letter-spacing: normal; float: none; direction: ltr; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span class="math"><span><span><span class="mrow"><span class="mn">2</span><span class="texatom"><span class="mrow"><span class="mo">/</span></span></span><span class="mn">3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;chance of having the right door, but that by staying with the door you had chosen you would have only a&nbsp;<span class="mathInline"><span class="MathJax" style="display: inline; font-family: serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; font-size: 18px; text-indent: 0px; text-align: left; letter-spacing: normal; float: none; direction: ltr; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span class="math"><span><span><span class="mrow"><span class="mn">1</span><span class="texatom"><span class="mrow"><span class="mo">/</span></span></span><span class="mn">3&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>chance at having selected the correct door. Many people disagreed with her. Not just people who knew nothing about probability.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/21/us/behind-monty-hall-s-doors-puzzle-debate-and-answer.html?src=pm" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">PHD's were letting her know she had gotten the wrong answer</a>&nbsp;as well.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">The Monty Hall problem is famous for having sparked so much disagreement. It is taught about in statistics courses across the country. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr_xWfThjJ0" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">problem has even been covered in the movie 21</a>. I once gave the problem to my family. When I shared with them the correct answer they refused to accept it. We argued over it for hours before I managed to convince them that I was right. The thing is, there are more disagreements than just this one. People get probability wrong all the time; This is just a famous example.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">Sports fans believe that hot streaks are a very real thing. They might be angry with a coach for not putting the game in the hands of a hot player. Studies don't agree with them. They have looked at the&nbsp;<a href="http://wexler.free.fr/library/files/gilovich%20(1985)%20the%20hot%20hand%20in%20basketball.%20on%20the%20misperception%20of%20random%20sequences.pdf" style="margin-top: 0px;">so-called streaks</a>&nbsp;in sports. It turns out that there is no such thing. What we see as a streak is actually just random chance. We get confused about streaks outside of sports too. Peter Norvig wrote about our inability to spot true randomness in an article about&nbsp;<a href="http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">proper experimental design</a>.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">Then there was the rather famous study in which doctors were asked to determine how likely a patient was to have cancer. They were given all the numbers they would need to come to the right answer, but almost all of them didn't. Most of the doctors claimed that the patients were very likely to have cancer. In truth, there chance of having cancer wasn't that high at all. The doctors got the question wrong by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">The list of ways humans make mistakes when thinking and working with probability is a long one. Humans might be able to calculate probabilities, but we don't seem to find it intuitive.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">Earlier I did a probability problem I found in the back of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms" style="margin-top: 0px;">Introduction To Algorithms</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.joshuacol.es/online-education-the-textbook" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">book which I wrote</a>&nbsp;about earlier.

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify; margin: 0px;">A deck of 10 cards, each bearing a distinct number from 1 to 10, is shuffled to mix the cards thoroughly. Three cards are removed one at a time from the deck. What is the probability that the three cards are selected in sorted (increasing) order?</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">I decided that the answer to the problem was that&nbsp;<span class="mathInline" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span class="MathJax" style="display: inline; font-family: serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; font-size: 18px; text-indent: 0px; text-align: left; letter-spacing: normal; float: none; direction: ltr; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span class="math"><span><span><span class="mrow"><span class="mfrac"><span><span><span class="mn">1/</span></span><span><span class="mn">6th</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>of the time the cards would be drawn in ascending order. After all, for each set of three cards there are six different orders in which they can be drawn, but only one of these orderings will be sorted properly. When I shared this answer with my dad, he rejected it immediately. Minutes later I found myself with ten cards in my hand running through things manually and trying to prove to him that my answer was the right one. We went through twenty deals without ever having seen the cards dealt in ascending order and suddenly my father was sure: I was wrong, and he was right.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; text-align: justify;">Thousands of draws tell a different story:</p>

;; A deck of ten cards each bearing a distinct number
;; between one and ten are shuffled in order to mix the
;; cards thouroughly. Three cards are removed from the 
;; deck one at a time. What is the probability that the
;; three cards are selected in sorted order?

;; First lets create the deck...
(def cards (range 1 11)) ;; =&gt; [1 2 3 ... 9 10]

;; (2 7 8)

(defn ascending? [draws] (apply &lt; draws))

;; Now lets say we try drawing a few thousands times...
